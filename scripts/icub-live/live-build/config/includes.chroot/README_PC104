Software on the pc104 relies on an external server for three main services:
Network file system	needed to access application code, both source and binaries
Network Time Protocol	to be synchronized with server
Internet connection - gateway

In order to have those services up and running at boot, many configurations files need to be properly set-up, they are:
/etc/fstab	store nfs configuration
/etc/ntp.conf	store ntp configuration (used by ntpdate to get actual date, ntp daemon is not installed)
/etc/network/interfaces	store ethernet configuration all other services rely on
/etc/hosts	not striclty needed in fact, but update this file will keep your icubserver hostname and address associated

Depending on your network configuration, ntp server, nfs server and gateway can have different ip addresses, therefore each file has to be updated when something changes
